# ZStd.jl

A Julia wrapper for the [Zstandard](http://www.zstd.net) library for fast, real-time compression.

Note that while Zstandard itself supports Windows, this package currently does not.
Support may be added in the future, provided I'm able to successfully cross-compile the requisite Windows DLLs.
